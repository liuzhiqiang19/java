给出的英文段落：
But we've done a couple ofthings, and I'll come quickly to your question.From the start of this
administration, we've made an investment, a reinvestment, in our alliances, in our partnerships, and in
the multilateral system.We've reinvested, we've re-engaged, we've tried to rejuvenate, we've even
reimagined. And the reason for that is simple: it's because it's in our interest to do it. Not a single one
of the challenges that we have to face and that are so important to the interests of the American
people can we effectively deal with alone, as powerful and as resourceful as we are. And so across the
board, we've seen our comparative advantage as having a strong network of voluntary alliances,
voluntary partnerships. And if you're not at the table in the international system, you're going to be on
the menu. So it was very important for us to re-engage multilaterally, and we've done that.
